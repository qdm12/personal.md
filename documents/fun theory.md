Early 2016

I have a new theory which may appear stupid at first. 

Let me first describe a few facts. 

We inspired most of our inventions from nature, animals and other beings. Recently, especially from the XXth century, we started innovating more and more concepts which are not inspired from nature but more from random thoughts of persons. This brings a new variety of ideas and make of our civilisation an even more unique civilisation. 

Now, as described before, we used several concepts from other beings. For example, by watching and analysing ants, we understood their hierarchy and managerial concepts and used those for our own purposes. But the ants never found out we were out there observing and learning from them without any interaction. And any ant who would ask another ant about a more advanced civilisation observing their civilisation would be considered as foul.

Let me now tell a fictive story. Let's say we, humans, greatly evolved for another 1000 years and went out in space to meet other also advanced civilisations. Similar to star trek in some way. Let's now say I, the narrator, would be the representant of our civilisation. "We had great and amazing ideas and we are still having some with a tenth of them which actually can work and be useful. However, we are not changing what we have invented in the past that much. Rather than thinking about the best way to implement these past inventions, we prefer to focus on future inventions which in some way depend on the basis built from the past inventions. Now let's say there are two exact same planets, let's say 2 planet Earth with only Nature and animals -no humans or civilisation-. We then send twenty new born humans to each planet. After 2000 years, even if they were humans on the two exact same planets, they will have different inventions. Some may use electricity whilst other would use petrol on the other planet. Some inventions may be better or more efficient than on the other planet. And the more time they spend on their planet, the more variety of innovations there will be. Similarly for the differences between the two planets. The more they are, the more variety of ideas there will be. This would give us a live-prototyping and comparison of new ideas which would allow us to optimise past inventions or even to create new ones we never thought about. If we send another specy able to evolve, this would again increase the possibilities." Now let's say this proposal get approved by some advanced masters of the advanced civilisation. The human civilisation (the advanced one) buys 20 solar systems (not to build hotels or do safaris though) and sends humans to each of them. "They will never know each other as they are too apart from each other. And we will observe them and they will never notice our presence. We will observe and analyse them to learn from them, as we were doing back in the days with the ants. This is the new entrepreneurship and long term project management."


Let's get back to reality and numbers. Earth is huge. It is impossible to visit all of it in a human lifetime. Our solar system makes of the Earth a grain of dust. From what we know, there are a lot of solar systems. A lot. We observed 7 galaxies and hundreds of solar systems. Now think. This brings the probability that there is a more advanced civilisation to 1.00 really... Maybe you will consider me as a foul. Maybe we are the ants on the other side of the glass. Maybe we were sent here to be observed. Well in some way this is motivating and shows we may be useful even to more clever guys!

Yes I'm going back to work I will continue that theory later on haha
